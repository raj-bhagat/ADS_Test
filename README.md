occur with additional information like, plane number, takeoff or landing. Design and implement
suitable data structures that work efficiently in terms of time.Â Time stamp can be for 00.00 AM
is considered as 0, 11.30 AM as 1130, 1.30 PM as 1330 and so on.
### question 3
  1.Insert an event with a given time stamp, aircraft number, takeoff / landing (add a future vent).
  2.Print the sequence of all takeoff and landing in the order of time stamp.
